# 03-Branching-plot-novel

Choose your adventure! This is the third programming assignment for ILS-Z399. The requirements for this assignment are as follows:

* Write a Python program for playing a simple "branching-plot novel" game
* A branching-plot novel is a work of fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making choices. The narrative branches along various paths, determined by the reader's choices. ([Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook) about branching-plot novels.)
* Present the player with a narrative segment and a series of choices
* Each of those choices branches to a new narrative segment
* Provide some happy and some sad endings

To get a perfect score, you will need to think creatively! Think about ways you can make this project more interesting or fun.

To complete this assignment you will need to understand:

* Python basic control structures like [if and else (and elif)](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/ifstatements.html)
* How to [compare](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/comparison_operators_example.htm) two values in Python
* How to [accept user input](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/io.html)
* How to create and call a [function](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions) in Python
